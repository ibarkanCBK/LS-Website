  <h2>Services</h2>
  <p>Lion’s Story develops and focuses on racial literacy via three types of services: foundational training, consulting and
        assessment. <br>Our services are facilitated by clinicians, therapists, diversity & inclusion specialists, administrators
        and thought leaders in the field.</p>

<div class = 'trainings' id='trainings-id'>
  <h2>Trainings</h2>
  <p>The foundational Racial Literacy training prepares participants (students, educators, leaders, practitioners, etc) to become better observers and change agents of their own racially insecure and stress-burdened thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. We supportively provide feedback on how to use racial literacy (including knowledge, skills and tools) while participants are simultaneously using mindfulness and stress management to lighten the burden that racial politics brings.
      <br><br>
      All Lion’s Story trainings are:
     <br>
          <ol>
            <li class='training-li'>Led by LS Racial literacy Trainers who are therapists, diversity & inclusion specialists, administrators and thought leaders in the fields of positive youth development, education, psychology and organizational leadership</li>
            <li class='training-li'>Grounded in evidence-based therapeutic approaches, fueled by decades of research</li>
            <li class='training-li'>All trainings involved individual, paired, small and large group work</li>
            <li class='training-li'>Practice of storytelling, journaling, debating & role-playing</li>
            <li class='training-li'>Conducted in 1-Day, 3-Day or 5-Day formats</li>
            <li class='training-li'>Can work across developmental stages (ages 10 and up)</li>
          </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br><br>
      The course will help participants competently address diversity related conflicts by establishing environments of mutual respect and trust, boosting ethical and thoughtful decision-making, and increasing worker performance and productivity. We expect participants to become racially assertive enough to ethically speak and act using their occupational expertise during face-to-face racial encounters without overreacting or under-reacting.
      <br><br>
      At the completion of training, participants will be able to:
      <br>
          <ol>
            <li class='training-li'>Explain the definition and range of racial stress during racial storytelling</li>
            <li class='training-li'>Learn and explain the definition of racial literacy and recast theory</li>
            <li class='training-li'>Learn the steps of successful racial negotiation using homework exercises</li>
            <li class='training-li'>Regulate their emotional reactions during FTF racial encounters and make better decisions of racial coping, speaking, and problem-solving</li>
            <li class='training-li'>Explain Calculate, Locate, and Communicate, Breathe & Exhale (CLCBE). Identify thoughts, body reactions, and self-talk during racially stressful conversation; then Breathe and exhale during racially stressful conversations</li>
            <li class='training-li'>Practice racial stress reduction in FTF racial encounters relevant to their roles</li>
            <li class='training-li'>Catalogue successful and unsuccessful racial encounters and seek help through supervision from REC staff</li>
          </ol>
      </p>

<div class='assessments'>
<h2>Assessments</h2>
  <p>Lion’s Story will also provide custom assessments of an organization’s current racial literacy climate and skills, as well as assess their progress and development. For more information about assessments, please contact us directly.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='consulting'>
<h2>Consulting</h2>
  <p>We consult with organizations and people who have participated in our trainings (or are planning to do so) and are committed to involve other, and hopefully all, of their stakeholders. As a result of the positive effects of becoming more racially literate, we also believe that intentions and ideas must be buttressed by time and resources in order to build the internal architecture for organizations to shift their strategic direction. With that intention we commit to supporting that evolution in whatever way possible - open ears, creative ideas, support of strategic planning, on-site observations, etc.
