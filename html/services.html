  <p>Lion’s Story develops and focuses on racial literacy via three types of services: foundational training, consulting and
        assessment. <br>Our services are facilitated by clinicians, therapists, diversity & inclusion specialists, administrators
        and thought leaders in the field.</p>

  <h2>Services</h2>
  <p>Our foundational trainings, consulting (which we also refer to as thought partnership) and assessment  The trainings are the primary medium with which we introduce racial literacy as a concept and goal, build skills in people and organizations and practice said skills. We consult with organizations who have participated in our trainings (or are planning to do so) and are committed to involve other stakeholders, focus time and resources and shift their strategic direction, as a result of the positive effects of becoming more racially literate. We will assess an organization’s current racial literacy climate and skills as well as continue to assess their progress and development as well. </p>

  <h2>Trainings</h2>
  <p>The foundational Racial Literacy training prepares participants (students, educators, leaders, practitioners, etc) to become better observers and change agents of their own racially insecure and stress-burdened thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. To improve these understandable insecurities, we supportively help each participant to explore their past, current racial experiences and encounters. We supportively provide feedback on how to use racial literacy (including knowledge, skills and tools) while participants are simultaneously using mindfulness and stress management to lighten the burden that racial politics brings. We supportively prepare participants to become more racially competent and effective as students, colleagues, leaders, and partners in their relationships at school, work, and home. 
     <br> 
     <br>

      Whether you are engaging with us through our trainings, consulting or assessments, racial literacy and health is central to our work. We believe when racially lIteracy skills are practiced & used to engage relationships in marginalized and non-marginalized communities, participants will be able to identify the emotional and physical health benefits of that practice.  Culturally responsive practices are a necessary byproduct of our standard mode of operation. The training will introduce and embrace a number of diverse and intersectional racial perspectives about the same subject matter or story. Through storytelling, journaling, stress management practice, debate, role-playing, open exchange and dialogue, participants will learn to observe, evaluate, and alter their insecure fight, flight and fright responses during racially stressful moments. We will help participants replace the helplessness of “Deer-in-the-Headlights” moments with thoughtful and emotionally intelligent courageous actions. Through feelings of racial illiteracy, we become aware of our insecurities but our approach which encourages reflection on these in-the-moment stress reactions, is meant to reduce that helplessness. Over time, participants will learn to manage these stress reactions in face-to-face  racial interactions, and make better decisions. Through this training, and with participant improvement in emotional and physical health outcomes, we expect greater satisfaction in other aspects of one’s personal and professional lives.
     <br> 
     <br>
      Lastly, the course will help participants competently address diversity related conflicts by establishing environments of mutual respect and trust, boosting ethical and thoughtful decision-making, and increasing worker performance and productivity.We expect participants to become racially assertive enough to ethically speak and act using  their occupational expertise during FTF racial encounters without overreacting or under-reacting. We will also evaluate the effectiveness of the training through pre-mid-post measurement of participant progress.
