    <p>For over twenty years, Charles  worked on behalf of children in schools and not-for- profit settings. His personal educational background traces a K-12 arc as a student of several urban public schools and an A Better Chance student at an  independent school. His higher education path wound through the Ivy League, a historically Black university’s law school, and a state school. Starting as an AmeriCorps member in the traditionally African-American Shaw neighborhood in Washington, DC, Charles returned to New York and unintentionally became an educator himself Without the formulaic five-year plan, yet well aware of the educational hurdles and roadblocks facing children and communities,Charlesbegan working in a Brooklyn middle school just a short subway ride from his mother’s childhood home.
    <br></br>
    In hindsight, Charles now sees himself as an unintentional storm chaser of urban education reform. As a district school leader, he worked in New York schools under Mayor Bloomberg and Chancellor Joel Klein. During Michelle Rhee’s Washington, DC tenure, he  led an innovative, college preparatory, public charter boarding school as the entire city upgraded the expectations for both schools and students. So now, after heading Teach For America’s Greater Philadelphia Region supporting the talent efforts of public schools, he is in Philadelphia with Dr. Hite, mayoral control and the City’s newly formed, local Board of Education.
    <br></br>
    According to a framework created by Gloria Ladson-Billings, Charles considers himself a coach and a conductor who sees education as one effective  tool to fuel and fight injustice. Charles now teaches an undergraduate education course focused on Education in American Culture and also a graduate class on cultural sustaining pedagogy.  Charles also consults with the School of District of Philadelphia and area not for profits.
    <br></br>
    Charles has a Bachelors of Science from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, a Juris Doctorate from The Howard University School of Law and a Masters of Education from Baruch College - The City University of New York. He also is licensed to practice law in Pennsylvania and serve as a school administrator.
