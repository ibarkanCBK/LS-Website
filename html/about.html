  <div class='racial-literacy'>
    <h2>What is Racial Literacy?</h2>
      <p>Racial literacy is the ability to read, recast, and resolve racially stressful  or identity-based encounters. This literacy is developed through supportive and repeated practice of healthy racial coping behaviors. The training of racial literacy involves the creation of humane spaces that provide affirming and protective feedback that also holds participants accountable as they learn to build their racial confidence, reduce their stress during racially charged moments, and negotiate racial conflicts to healthy conclusions.</p>
  </div>
  <span></span>
  <div class='our-approach'>
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>While we are aware of and challenge systemic social injustices that shape our communities, we take a more proximal approach to racial conflict resolution. We teach skills that address face-to-face and in-the-moment racial encounters. We expect this work to help participants improve the quality of their racial interactions with colleagues, family members, and friendships; mature their racial identity development, and find their (social justice) voice by strengthening the link between their ideas and actions.

          We work with all age groups from youth to adults, across various sectors of education, health, justice and business, and across populations of front-line, middle management, and administrative leaders and professionals.
          
          By leveraging  the power of storytelling and racial literacy skill development, we expect to promote emotional and relationship health on multiple levels. Our direct work begins with practitioners, staff and leaders of organizations, which indirectly impacts their client base, students and/or community. Eventually, we will deliver the direct face-to-face training to  the clients (ex. students) themselves. We expect Lion’s Story will cultivate healthy climates and teach practices that influence activists, professionals, families and youth to
          recognize and resist narratives of racial dehumanization about their histories, cultures, and genius
          reconnect to and assert their own narratives of trauma and healing
          recover from the trauma of racism and improve their emotional, psychological, and physical coping and health and
          record and share the impact of applying these racial coping  health processes and behaviors to everyday encounters.</p>

        <h3>Dr. Howard C. Stevenson</h3>
        <h4>Founder</h4>
      </div>
     <p>Dr. Howard Stevenson is the Constance Clayton Professor of Urban Education, Professor of Africana Studies, in the Human Development & Quantitative Methods Division of the Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the Executive Director of the Racial Empowerment Collaborative at Penn, designed to promote racial literacy research, training, and programming in education, health, community and justice institutions.
     <br></br>
     Backed by a $12 million grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and based at REC, Howard also directs Forward Promise, a national philanthropic office that promotes a culture of health for boys and young men of color, to help them heal from the trauma of historical and present-day dehumanization, discrimination and colonization.
     <br></br>
     He is a nationally recognized clinical psychologist and researcher on negotiating racial conflicts using racial literacy for independent and public K-12 schooling, community mental health centers, teachers, leaders, police and parents. Two mental health research projects funded by National Institutes of Health examine the benefits of racial literacy. The PLAAY (Preventing Long-term Anger and Aggression in Youth) Project uses the physical activity of basketball and the literacy skills building of racial socialization to help youth and parents cope with stress from violence and social dehumanization. Dr. Stevenson also co-leads with Drs. Loretta and John Jemmott, the SHAPE-UP: Barbers Building Better Brothers Project which trains Black barbers as health educators to teach Black 18-24 year old males to reduce their risk of -- HIV/STDS and retaliation violence -- while they are cutting hair.
     <br></br>
     His book, Promoting Racial Literacy in Schools: Differences that Make a Difference, is designed to reduce racial threat reactions in face-to-face encounters. Howard’s research and clinical work have been funded by W.T. Grant Foundation, Annenberg Foundation, and the National Institutes of Mental Health and Child Health and Human Development.

        For over twenty years, Charles  worked on behalf of children in schools and not-for- profit settings. His personal educational background traces a K-12 arc as a student of several urban public schools and an A Better Chance student at an  independent school. His higher education path wound through the Ivy League, a historically Black university’s law school, and a state school. Starting as an AmeriCorps member in the traditionally African-American Shaw neighborhood in Washington, DC, Charles returned to New York and unintentionally became an educator himself Without the formulaic five-year plan, yet well aware of the educational hurdles and roadblocks facing children and communities,Charlesbegan working in a Brooklyn middle school just a short subway ride from his mother’s childhood home.

As a district school leader, he worked in New York schools under Mayor Bloomberg and Chancellor Joel Klein. During Michelle Rhee’s Washington, DC tenure, he  led an innovative, college preparatory, public charter boarding school as the entire city upgraded the expectations for both schools and students. So now, after heading Teach For America’s Greater Philadelphia Region supporting the talent efforts of public schools, he is in Philadelphia with Dr. Hite, mayoral control and the City’s newly formed, local Board of Education.
      <br></br>
        According to a framework created by Gloria Ladson-Billings, Charles considers himself a coach and a conductor who sees education as one effective  tool to fuel and fight injustice. Charles now teaches an undergraduate education course focused on Education in American Culture and also a graduate class on cultural sustaining pedagogy.  Charles also consults with the School of District of Philadelphia and area not for profits.
      <br></br>
        Charles has a Bachelors of Science from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, a Juris Doctorate from The Howard University School of Law and a Masters of Education from Baruch College - The City University of New York. He also is licensed to practice law in Pennsylvania and serve as a school administrator.
