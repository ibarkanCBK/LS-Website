          <h2>Approach</h2>
</-->
          <p>Lion’s Story teaches culturally relevant, mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral, relationship-building strategies that are
          based on thirty years of racial socialization research by Dr. Howard C. Stevenson of the University of Pennsylvania.

          Racial literacy is the ability to read, recast, and resolve racially stressful or identity-based encounters. This
          literacy is developed through supportive and repeated practice of healthy racial coping behaviors. The training of
          racial literacy involves the creation of humane spaces that provide affirming and protective feedback that also holds
          participants accountable as they learn to build their racial confidence, reduce their stress during racially charged
          moments, and negotiate racial conflicts to healthy conclusions.

          How do we practice racial literacy? Our team of trainers facilitates mindfulness-infused activities for individuals and
          groups that encourage participants to “courageously notice” their thoughts, feelings, and body reactions as they
          navigate racial stories from (or about) their childhood, family, and professional dilemmas.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>When Lion’s Story was originally founded in 2003 by Dr. Brian Peterson and Dr. Howard Stevenson, it was designed to be
          the not-for-profit umbrella for Ase Academy -- a Saturday academic and cultural enrichment program that connects young
          people in Philadelphia with Penn student mentors that has existed for over 20 years. After years of dormancy, Lion’s
          Story was revived in 2018 in order to address the national (and global) need for racial literacy. Lion’s Story now
          serves as a not-for--profit hub to promote three key village healing interests: racial literacy and health, life-span
          educational success of Black and Brown youth and adults, and competent culturally responsive leadership.</p>

        <p>“I’ve been in a lot of racial equity trainings, and this was my favorite.  It invited vulnerability and courage in a way that deepened connection and understanding of the personal implications of systemic oppression.  For people with privilege (like me) it opened my heart and inspired me to take action to help dismantle these oppressive systems by simply beginning conversations about race.  It also forged connections and friendship with people who are wrestling with the implications of racism and want to take action.” <br>- Meghan Ryan</p>

      <div class="story-card" id="">
        <p>“My experience with Lion's Story helped me reflect on past and prepare for future racial encounters in a way that felt practical and productive. The Lion's Story framework around the relationship between stress, fear and physiological response makes a healthy coping strategy feel attainable and applicable to everyday encounters. I am glad I was able to fully participate in this training, which I think will be an invaluable resource for shifting mindset, developing personal coping strategies and, most importantly, widening the circle of understanding as we navigate this world.”</p>
